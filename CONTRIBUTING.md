## 🧰 Project Structure

This repository is a Rust workspace with two crates:

   - A clear title and description.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Expected vs actual behavior.
   - Minimal code example or schema.

- Describe the problem you're trying to solve.
- Explain how your suggestion addresses it.
- Optionally, suggest an implementation path.
